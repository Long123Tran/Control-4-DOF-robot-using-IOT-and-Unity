# IOT 4-DOF ROBOT CONTROL USING ADAFRUIT AND UNITY
# INTRODUCTION OF PROJECT
    Our project will create the Unity application to control the 4-DOF robot postion by controlling the rotation of each motor. We create the GUI to input the angle of motors on Unity, MQTT will read the values and send to AdaFruit. AdaFruit will send those values to ESP8266 through MQTT. Motors can be controlled by PWM signal from ESP8266 module.
